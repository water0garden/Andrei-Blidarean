Featuredproductdescription:

Gloria,
 a perfume for Kristine Mary Crabb, transmutes the artist’s vision into an ambrosial nectar that at once evokes a feeling of primordial and modern worlds. Inspired by the artist’s grandmother’s garden,

Gloria is a poetic floral bouquet, fortified with woody spices and grounded by a dark, dirty earthiness. Like silk draped on skin, the fragrance softly flows and merges with the movement and curves of a body dappled in golden sunlight, pulsing with blood, joyously in love.

Notes:  Musk, Jasmine, freesia, mimosa, camelia, Lily of the Valley, Clovebud, Sandalwood, Ambergris

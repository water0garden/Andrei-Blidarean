Garment Care

All pieces by Gloria are made in NZ by top crafts people and manufacturers. Each piece has gone through at least 5 pairs of hand and/or processes. Gloria uses mostly natural fibres such as silk, cotton and wool which will often get better with age and a little extra care. Please adhere to the garment care instructions on the labels when caring for your very special pieces and use your common sense.
